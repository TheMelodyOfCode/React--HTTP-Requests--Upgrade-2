# REACT-HTTP-Requests - Upgrade - 2  
### REACT & Firebase

#### 
> This is an upgrade to my series of React-HTTP-Requests projects</br>
>    
>   
  
> **general functionality:**
>> recieving a trading-Card when entering the name in the formfield or clicking the button  
>> showing a list of previous chosen trading-cards  
>> mounting/unmounting the app when un/-checking the checkbox

> This exercise was to work with :</br>
>> useState</br>
>> useEffect</br>
>> useReducer</br>
>> useContext</br>

#### useState vs. useReducer
> - When it's just an independent element of state you're managing:   useState  
> - When one element of your state relies on the value of another element of your state in order to update:   useReducer  

#### Firebase
> In the Utils Folder, you will find all files related to Firebase</br>
>> There is a tradingCards_DATA.js file for Firestore db in case you want to create your own.</br>
>> The current configuration in the firebase.utils file works though.</br>

#### React APP
> Run the app from the main folder - npm start</br>
> Will run on localhost:3000</br>

> I want to give credit to **Kent C. Dodds** </br>
